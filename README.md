- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
 ***The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. The game will be called “Draw It or Lose It” and is currently only available on android. The purpose of this game is multiple teams consisting of several people going four rounds at a minute each. When a picture is pulled from a library of images one team guesses till time runs out. If not answered each opposing team member gets to answer till 15 seconds runs out.
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  ***I think I did well on the first Project and the game coding part.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  ***As a visual person I can say that flowchart was vert well details and set up was easily understood to follow, so it was a great way for me to follow with no questions. 
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- ***I would work on the functional and non-functional  requirements by getting feedback from the clients which would be an ideal option to actually know what my mistakes are in my projects to know for future reference.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
***I did my best to break down all required bullet points that were asked of us to make the client happy and followed each step by giving detailed information as much as possible. Happy customer, happy life!. we serve the customer to the best of our knowledge so that they know, they are paying for what they asked.
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
***It is very important to note that the company's perspectie can be different from my own. How i see the problem and what is important to me might not be as important to them. So that is one thing to consider. Another point is to find out what type of software or platforms they are currently using and planning to use, so that we can create the project that they are looking for by finding out what the user needs, what they want to achieve and what could be imploved.
